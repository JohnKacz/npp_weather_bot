See the [`nerves_interim_wifi`](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_interim_wifi) module and

example project.

>#### Note:

> On ACU campus wifi you will need to use the "BasicACUwifi" network. Connecting to this 
network utilizes a [captive portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_portal) which 
will require you to register your devices MAC address using your ACU credentials. 
The easiest way to do this is by:

>1. Get your raspberry piâ€™s MAC address 
 - Boot into Raspbian or some other flavor of Linux
 - Open the terminal (if in the GUI)
 - run `cat /sys/class/net/wlan0/address`
2. Go [here](https://clearpass.acu.edu/guest/auth_login.php?target=%2Fguest%2Fmac_create.php) 
(while behind the ACU firewall)
3. Sign-in using ACU credentials
4. Enter a Device Name; Device Type: Other; MAC Address: <MAC ADDR OF RPI3>

If your weather station will be running on a different network be sure to change the config 
setting for `:ssid`, `:key_mgmt`, and `:psk`
